# Project 3: Spots

### Overview  

In this project we were given a figma design and asked to recreate it in vs code. The design was basically a mock up for a user's profile page in an app called 'spots' which appears to be an image sharing socia media platform focused on sharing places the user has been. I used a combination of flex box and grid to achieve the layout, as was suggested in the vimeo series covering the project by Kevin Lougstead
