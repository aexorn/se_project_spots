# Project 3: Spots

### Overview  

In this project we were given a [figma design](https://www.figma.com/design/BBNm2bC3lj8QQMHlnqRsga/Sprint-3-Project%3A-Spots?node-id=2-60&node-type=frame&t=zdGgsrjoUkZLuHdz-0) and asked to recreate it in vs code. The design was basically a mock up for a user's profile page in an app called 'spots' which appears to be an image sharing socia media platform focused on sharing places the user has been. I used a combination of flex box (profie and individua card content) and grid(area below profile whith all of the user's posts) to achieve the layout, as was suggested in the[vimeo series](https://vimeo.com/954096415?share=copy) covering the sprint 3 project by Kevin. I explain my choices and experience with this project at greater length in this[video](https://www.loom.com/share/906265b655044b24a11ba91238e2a6fb?sid=74e5786b-0cfa-4855-ab80-ae47ba995a1b)

*I forgot to mention one of my favorite parts f this project in the video which was adding an animation to the active psuedo-class of the 'like' button heart which, once we are asked to introduce js into the project next sprint, I plan to remove and instead attach it to an event listener for the click event of the like button, as currenty its only visible when 'actively' holding the click down on the 'like' heart. for the animation I used @keyframes with a scale transform and opacity, increasing scale as I decrease opacity so the heart seems to grow untill it dissolves, an effect I've seen on other platforms simiar to 'Spots'. I really enjoy doing css animations, especially when I can get them to do what I intended !
